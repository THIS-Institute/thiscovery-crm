    This test checks that lambda function RecordUserRegistration can receive
    a ss Auth0 event as input and save a registration notification to the queue
    of notifications to be processed in the Dynamodb notifications table. If we
    keep the notification structure the same as it is at present in thiscovery-core,
    it will look like this:
    {
        "id": "89ed5ae0-1f37-489f-ba58-16c5ac7bad60",
        "processing_status": "new",
        "label": "altha@email.co.uk",
        "created": "2022-02-25 10:48:31.407821+00:00",
        "details": {
            "created": "2022-02-25 10:48:31.164191+00:00",
            "avatar_string": "AA",
            "last_name": "Alcorn",
            "title": null,
            "country_code": "GB",
            "crm_id": null,
            "country_name": "United Kingdom - England",
            "modified": "2022-02-25 10:48:31.164191+00:00",
            "id": "89ed5ae0-1f37-489f-ba58-16c5ac7bad60",
            "auth0_id": "6218b3ff6a20e40071c72e51",
            "first_name": "Altha",
            "email": "Altha",
            "status": "new"
        },
        "modified": "2022-02-25 10:53:17.312532+00:00",
        "type": "user-registration"
    }

    Note that:
        - this test only checks the notification was added to the processing queue.
            The correct processing of notifications of this type needs to be tested
            separately
        - when this notification is processed, we will receive a crm_id back from
            HubSpot for this user. That needs to be passed back to thiscovery-core
            so that it can be stored in RDS. I suggest doing so via an EventBridge
            event
